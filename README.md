# shoe-inventory
# Description:
This project is an inventory management program that will store shoe information
and allow for checking in of new shoes to a users inventory and will read from a csv file
that contains all the information. The information is then taken from that csv file and stored
in internal ArrayLists that will keep track of the inventory as well as a cart for that user.
The user will be able to place and order from shoes in the inventory and can add new shoes to inventory
that are waiting to arrive and be added. Each screen contains buttons to navigate from screen to screen
and will allow users to return to the home screen or to view their profile and cart. There is also a search
screen that will allow the user to search their inventory for a specific shoe or close matches and they can
then view details about that specific shoe. The hope is that the program will allow for companies and individuals
to keep track of shoes in their inventory and incoming arrivals and place orders based on customers.
# How To Ensure Properly Installed:
The user should ensure they have a data folder containing two csv files, one named shoes.csv with the shoes already
in the inventory, and then another named shoesToCheckIn.csv that will contain the shoes that are still waiting
to be added to the inventory properly. If the user wishes to properly display images as well then the csv should
contain a proper location to the shoe image. Also, the user should ensure that the csv file they are using contains proper
input especially for stock which should only be an integer.
